## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd at `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs. Never run commands to serve the site. It is always available.
- Use the `herd` CLI to manage services, PHP versions, and sites (e.g. `herd sites`, `herd services:start <service>`, `herd php:list`). Run `herd list` to discover all available commands.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== ATMA Journey project rules ===

# ATMA Journey — Project Guide

Multitenant SaaS for health clinics that digitizes the *Método Atma Soma* patient journey.
Core promise: **no patient is forgotten at any stage of the funnel**. Unifies CRM/retention,
scheduling, clinical records (prontuário), and finance into one timeline-based product. UI is
Brazilian Portuguese. We are migrating it from `../atma-journey-ts` (React + Firebase) to Laravel 13.

**Authoritative design docs — read before working in a domain:**
- Program architecture & domain glossary: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-atma-journey-program-design.md`
- PRD collection (one per bounded context, built in order): `docs/prds/README.md`

## Locked architecture decisions

- **Frontend:** Pure **Livewire 4 + Alpine** on the **Livewire Starter Kit**. Use **free Flux (MIT)**
  components for the generic shell, layout, and forms (button, input, modal, dropdown, navbar, card,
  table…) — keep the starter kit's existing auth/settings. **NEVER use Flux Pro** (no license) and do
  not introduce React. Build the **Pro-gated interactive components ourselves** as in-house `x-ui.*`
  Blade + Alpine components styled to match Flux's tokens: Kanban (Pipeline, via SortableJS),
  calendar + date/time pickers (Scheduling), charts (Dashboard), combobox/searchable-select, file
  upload, tabs. `x-ui.*` lives in `resources/views/components/ui/`; free Flux lives in `resources/views/flux/`.
- **Multitenancy:** **`stancl/tenancy`**, **database-per-tenant**, **domain-based** identification,
  self-serve provisioning + custom domain mapping. `users` live in the **tenant** DB (one clinic per user);
  the **central** DB holds `tenants`, `domains`, billing, and Atma super-admins.
- **Domain layer:** **Fat Eloquent models + invokable Action classes** (`app/Actions/{Domain}/`). Do NOT
  wrap Eloquent in Repository classes. Livewire components stay thin.
- **Automation:** **Events + Listeners** (queued when slow) replace the old Firestore triggers.
- **Data:** Greenfield — factories + seeders only, no Firestore ETL.

## Conventions specific to this app

- Group by domain inside conventional folders: `app/Actions/{Domain}/`, `app/Livewire/{Domain}/`,
  `tests/Feature/{Domain}/`. Models stay flat in `app/Models/`. Tenant migrations go in
  `database/migrations/tenant/`.
- UI components live in `resources/views/components/ui/` as `x-ui.*`. Check there before building any new
  component.
- Pipeline stages (enum): `primeiro_contato, avaliacao, em_analise, orcamento_enviado, negociando,
  orcamento_aceito, agendado, retorno, concluido, desistentes`.
- User roles (enum): `admin`, `staff`. Finer RBAC is deferred — design for it, don't build it yet.

## Working rules for this migration

- **Mandatory TDD.** Every PRD and every change is built test-first (Pest, red→green→refactor). Most tests
  are feature tests; Actions get focused unit tests. Use `stancl/tenancy` test helpers for tenant isolation.
- **Build in PRD order** (see `docs/prds/README.md`). MVP = PRDs 0–5. Don't start a PRD before its
  dependencies are done.
- The TS app (`../atma-journey-ts`) is the **domain source of truth** — port business rules from its
  `src/services/` and `src/domain/`, not its Firestore infrastructure.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker
Issues are Trello cards on the *atma-journey* board (via the global `trello` MCP server); PRD specs stay as markdown in `docs/prds/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels
Triage state = Trello labels (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs
Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
